# es6-features
ES6 is embedded with a lot of interesting features. Find below things I found interesing that you could take advantage of in your next Javascipt project.

# Spread operators
The spread operator allows is used to ensure that an **array** or **iterable obeject** should have its content split into sepearte arguments within a call.
The spread operator is triggered with the `"..."` symbol

# Arrow Functions
Two factors influenced the introduction of arrow functions: shorter functions and non-binding of `this`.

# Template Literals 
Template Literals reduces the number of `+` operator used for string concatenation. Template literals also comes really handy when you are dealing with multiline strings.

# Destructuring
Destructuring is use to extract values from an array or objects which is being assigned to a variable.

# Find/FindIndex
This function extends the functionality of `indexOf`. `find/findIndex` provide a condition for the check. `find ` returns the first element that meets the condition in the array, while `findIndex` returns the index of the first element that meets the condition. 
The `find` returns `undefined` when none of the elements meets the condition, while `findIndex` returns `-1`.

# For...Of / For...In
They are basicaly used to iterate over arrays. They work like the `forEach` except it does not require `function` declaration. The major diference between these two methods is that : `For...Of` iterates over `values` while `For...In` iterates over `keys`

# Modules
Javascript modules promotes reusabilty and maintainibility of codes. There are two sides of Javascript Modules: Export and Import
Export functions allows a particular section to be usable
